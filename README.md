## Overview

**Word World** is a turn-based battle where classmates compete by placing letters on a grid to form words. The goal is to create the longest, most valuable words to score points. Each letter placed on the grid has the potential to contribute to a word in multiple directions, which adds a layer of strategy to the game. No global playersâ€”just classmates competing for the highest score!

## Gameplay

- The game begins on a blank 2D grid.
- Players take turns placing letters on the grid, with the objective of forming words.
- Words can be created horizontally or vertically.
- When a player successfully forms a word, they score points equivalent to the length of the word.
- The game continues until the grid is full or both players can no longer form words.
- The player with the highest score wins.

### Example
1. **Player 1** places the letter "C" in row 2, column 3.
2. **Player 2** places the letter "A" in row 2, column 4.
3. **Player 1** places the letter "T" in row 2, column 5, forming the word "CAT" and scoring 3 points.
